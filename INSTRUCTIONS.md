I have created all the files and directories as you requested, and populated them with the full code.

To get started, you need to install the project dependencies. Please run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

After the installation is complete, you can start the development server with this command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the application on a local server, and you can view it in your browser.
