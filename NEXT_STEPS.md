I have looked at your `src/styles/index.css` file. The content you have is the standard and correct way to set up Tailwind CSS. There are no problems in that file to fix.

It seems like we are working on two different issues. The main problem we need to solve is getting your application to run on `localhost`. Any styling issues you might be seeing are likely a symptom of the application not running correctly.

In my previous message, I asked you to perform a debugging step by simplifying the application to a "Hello World" page. I need to know the result of that test to be able to help you.

Could you please tell me what happened when you followed the instructions in `DEBUGGING_INSTRUCTIONS.md`? Did you see "Hello World!" or did you still see a "404 Not Found" error?

Once we get your application running, we can look at any styling problems you might have.

To move forward, please provide the result of the "Hello World" test. I am ready to help as soon as you provide that information. I have also restored the original content of `App.jsx`, so we are ready for the next step.
